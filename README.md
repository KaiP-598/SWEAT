An iOS App that allows you to the SWEAT recommended program

# User Stories
1. As a user I want to see the program name so I know what program I am registering to

4. As a user I want to see the program related tags so I know more about the program

# Assumptions
1. The program image is inaccessible from the server side so the trainer's image is used.
2. The SWEAT DROP's intensity has 3 levels at maximum
3. Some trainer is doing multiple programs so the trainer photo will look the same for some programs.
